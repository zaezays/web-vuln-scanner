WitzCore: A Web Vulnerability Scanner (Final Year Project)

WitzCore is a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) web vulnerability scanner built using Flask and integrated with security tools like OWASP ZAP API and Nikto. The system helps users scan websites for common web vulnerabilities and view detailed results in a clean, user-friendly dashboard. This project is designed to simplify web security testing while providing clear, actionable results for both normal users and administrators.
